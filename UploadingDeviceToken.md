# Mobile App Device Token Upload Documentation

This documentation outlines the process of uploading device tokens generated during the login process in a mobile app. The device tokens are crucial for enabling push notification features, allowing server-side integration to send targeted notifications.

## Overview

When users log into the mobile app, unique device tokens are generated by the operating system. These tokens play a vital role in identifying devices and enabling server-initiated communication, such as push notifications. Uploading these tokens to the server ensures that the backend can associate devices with user accounts and send notifications based on user-specific criteria.
